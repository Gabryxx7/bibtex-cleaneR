    abstract		= {This extraordinary three-volume work, written in an engaging and rigorous style by a world authority in the field, provides an accessible, comprehensive introduction to the full spectrum of mathematical and statistical techniques underpinning contemporary methods in data-driven learning and inference. This second volume, Inference, builds on the foundational topics established in volume I to introduce students to techniques for inferring unknown variables and quantities, including Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods, maximum-likelihood estimation, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, and reinforcement learning. A consistent structure and pedagogy is employed throughout this volume to reinforce student understanding, with over 350 end-of-chapter problems (including solutions for instructors), 180 solved examples, almost 200 figures, datasets and downloadable Matlab code. Supported by sister volumes Foundations and Learning, and unique in its scale and depth, this textbook sequence is ideal for early-career researchers and graduate students across many courses in signal processing, machine learning, statistical analysis, data science and inference.},

    abstract		= {This chapter analyzes why small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore have or have not adopted electronic commerce, and explains issues affecting its adoption. In recent years, the Singapore government has spearheaded the implementation of e-commerce in Singapore. SMEs still have not heeded the government’s call. In a survey conducted by AC Nielsen, commissioned by the National Computer Board of Singapore, it was found that of 13 percent of 1,500 randomly selected adults, only 6 percent made a purchase using the Internet (NCB, 1998). The reasons for Singapore’s SMEs’ uniform and widespread unwillingness to adopt e-commerce despite the government’s push, are still largely unknown. Research published on the Singapore Government’s e-commerce web site (http://www.ec.gov.sg) (also Singapore 2000; 1998a; 1998b), has information only on surveys showing that Internet users are still rather unsure of e-commerce, especially towards Internet commerce. What is required is information from the SME’s viewpoint. Already certain “seminal” advantages exist in adopting e-commerce, such as: cost savings, improved productivity and streamlined business processes. This research will obtain relevant information from selected SMEs in Singapore, to better understand issues that have led to the current e-commerce situation in Singapore. The Singaporean Government has consistently focused on promoting informatization and information industry development in the economic development strategy of the island economy (IMCM, 1998). Among developing countries, Singapore has achieved one of the highest rates of diffusion of information technology (Wong, 1996; Wong 1998; Corbitt & Thanasankit, 2002). Singapore has also been regularly rated as maintaining among the best telecommunications infrastructure in the world, according to the annual World Competitiveness Report (International Institute for Management Development, 1996). The “electric commercialization” of Singapore started in 1996 with the National Computer Board (NCB) and with the e-commerce Hotbed Program (ECH) to jumpstart the pervasive use of e-commerce and position Singapore as a hub for e-commerce. An e-commerce committee established six guiding principles to promote e-commerce in Singapore: • The private sector should take the lead • Government should create a framework that provides certainty and reliability • Government should provide a secure and safe environment • Joint venture pilots and experiments between Government and the private sector are needed to expedite e-commerce growth and development • Innovative, transparent and liberal policies should be proactively pursued by Government • Consistency with international regimes, international cooperation and interoperability are necessary for e-commerce to thrive (National Computer Board, 1998)},

    abstract		= {This chapter analyzes why small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore have or have not adopted electronic commerce, and explains issues affecting its adoption. In recent years, the Singapore government has spearheaded the implementation of e-commerce in Singapore. SMEs still have not heeded the government’s call. In a survey conducted by AC Nielsen, commissioned by the National Computer Board of Singapore, it was found that of 13 percent of 1,500 randomly selected adults, only 6 percent made a purchase using the Internet (NCB, 1998). The reasons for Singapore’s SMEs’ uniform and widespread unwillingness to adopt e-commerce despite the government’s push, are still largely unknown. Research published on the Singapore Government’s e-commerce web site (http://www.ec.gov.sg) (also Singapore 2000; 1998a; 1998b), has information only on surveys showing that Internet users are still rather unsure of e-commerce, especially towards Internet commerce. What is required is information from the SME’s viewpoint. Already certain “seminal” advantages exist in adopting e-commerce, such as: cost savings, improved productivity and streamlined business processes. This research will obtain relevant information from selected SMEs in Singapore, to better understand issues that have led to the current e-commerce situation in Singapore. The Singaporean Government has consistently focused on promoting informatization and information industry development in the economic development strategy of the island economy (IMCM, 1998). Among developing countries, Singapore has achieved one of the highest rates of diffusion of information technology (Wong, 1996; Wong 1998; Corbitt & Thanasankit, 2002).

The first four volumes are of text, and the larger Volume 5 contains plates. Hunter had begun his career as a demonstrator in the anatomy classes of his brother William, before qualifying as a surgeon. He regarded surgery as evidence of failure - the mutilation of a patient who could not be cured by other means - and his studies of anatomy and natural history were driven by his belief that it was necessary to understand the normal physiological processes before attempting to cure the abnormal ones. Volume 1 contains Ottley's biography, a list of Hunter's published works, and his lectures on surgery.},

This problem occurs frequently when trying to verify that an initialized loop satisfies some functional specification, i.e., produces outputs which are some function of the program inputs.The notion of a valid generalization of a loop specification is defined. A particularly simple valid generalization, a base generalization, is discussed. A property of many commonly occurring while loops, that of being uniformly implemented, is defined. A technique is presented which exploits this property in order to systematically achieve a valid generalization of the loop specification. Two classes of uniformly implemented loops that are particularly susceptible to this form of analysis are defined and discussed. The use of the proposed technique is illustrated with a number of applications. Finally, an implication of the concept of uniform loop implementation for the validation of the obtained generalization is explained.},

As a first step towards this end, the feasibility of unified command/programming/debugging languages, and the concepts on which such languages have to be based, are investigated. The unification process is accomplished in two phases. First, a unified command/programming framework is defined and, second, this framework is extended by adding an integrated debugging capability to it. Strict rules are laid down by which to judge language concepts presenting themselves as candidates for inclusion in the framework during each phase. On the basis of these rules many of the language design questions that have hitherto been resolved this way or that, depending on the taste of the designer, lose their vagueness and can be decided in an unambiguous manner.},

We surveyed smart speaker owners about their beliefs, attitudes, and concerns about the recordings that are made and shared by their devices. To ground participants’ responses in concrete interactions, rather than collecting their opinions abstractly, we framed our survey around randomly selected recordings of saved interactions with their devices. We surveyed 116 owners of Amazon and Google smart speakers and found that almost half did not know that their recordings were being permanently stored and that they could review them; only a quarter reported reviewing interactions, and very few had ever deleted any. While participants did not consider their own recordings especially sensitive, they were more protective of others’ recordings (such as children and guests) and were strongly opposed to use of their data by third parties or for advertising. They also considered permanent retention, the status quo, unsatisfactory. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for more agreeable data retention policies and future privacy controls.},

    abstract		= {A notification represents the proactive delivery of information to a user and reduces the need to visually scan or repeatedly check an external information source. At the same time, notifications often interrupt user tasks at inopportune moments, decreasing productivity and increasing frustration. Controlled studies have shown that linking notification delivery to the perceptual structure of a user's tasks can reduce these interruption costs. However, in these studies, the scheduling was always performed manually, and it was not clear whether it would be possible for a system to mimic similar techniques. This article contributes the design and implementation of a novel system called Oasis that aligns notification scheduling with the perceptual structure of user tasks. We describe the architecture of the system, how it detects task structure on the fly without explicit knowledge of the task itself, and how it layers flexible notification scheduling policies on top of this detection mechanism. The system also includes an offline tool for creating customized statistical models for detecting task structure. The value of our system is that it intelligently schedules notifications, enabling the reductions in interruption costs shown within prior controlled studies to now be realized by users in everyday desktop computing tasks. It also provides a test bed for experimenting with how notification management policies and other system functionalities can be linked to task structure.},

The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features.ResultsThe search found 1958 publications. After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly.ConclusionsMost of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and decision-making.},

The framework implements an intelligent combination of two research areas: (1) sensor- and camera-based monitoring to collect, analyse, and interpret people behaviour and (2) natural machine–human interaction through an apprehensive virtual assistant benefiting ailing patients. In addition, the framework serves as an important assistant to caregivers and clinical experts to obtain information about the patients in an intuitive manner. The proposed approach capitalises on latest breakthroughs in computer vision, sensor management, speech recognition, natural language processing, knowledge representation, dialogue management, semantic reasoning, and speech synthesis, combining medical expertise and patient history.},

While normally managed without consequence, basic research as well as aviation accident and incident investigations show that interruptions can negatively affect performance and safety. This research investigates the influence of interruption and interrupted task modality on pilot performance in a simulated commercial flight deck. Fourteen current commercial airline pilots performed approach scenarios in a fixed-base flight simulator. Air traffic control instructions, conveyed either aurally or visually ( via a data link system) interrupted a visual task (obtaining information from the Flight Management System) and an auditory task (listening to the automated terminal information service recording). Some results confirm the hypothesized performance advantage of cross-modality conditions, more compelling nature of auditory interruptions, and interruption-resistance of auditory ongoing tasks. However, taken together, results suggest the four interaction conditions had different effects on pilot performance. These results have implications for the design of data link systems, and for facilitating interruption management through interface design, aiding, and training programs.},

Since, these greatest technology’s appearance, an uprising has been created in the industry of mobile communication. These greatest inventions of mankind are not just constricted for calling these days. As the capabilities and the number of smartphone users increase day by day, smartphones are loaded with various types of sensors which captures each and every moment, activities of our daily life. Two of such sensors are Accelerometer and Gyroscope which measures the acceleration and angular velocity respectively. These could be used to identify the human activities performed. Basically, Human Activity Recognition is a classifying activity with so many use cases such as health care, medical, surveillance and anti-crime securities. Smartphones have wide variety of applications in various fields and can be used to excavate different kinds of data which provide accurate insights and knowledge about the user's lifestyle. Nowadays creating lifelogs that is a technology to capture and record a user's life through his or her mobile devices, are becoming very important task. An immense issue in creating a detailed lifelog is the accurate detection of activities performed by human based on the collected data from the sensors. The data in the lifelogs has strong association with physical health variables. These data are motivational and they identify any type of behavioral changes. These data provide us the overall measure of physical activity. In this project, we have analyzed the smartphone sensors produced data and used them to recognize the activities performed by the user.},

    abstract		= {Multifrequency media access control has been well understood in general wireless ad hoc networks, while in wireless sensor networks, researchers still focus on single frequency solutions. In wireless sensor networks, each device is typically equipped with a single radio transceiver and applications adopt much smaller packet sizes compared to those in general wireless ad hoc networks. Hence, the multifrequency MAC protocols proposed for general wireless ad hoc networks are not suitable for wireless sensor network applications, which we further demonstrate through our simulation experiments. In this article, we propose MMSN, which takes advantage of multifrequency availability while, at the same time, takes into consideration the restrictions of wireless sensor networks. In MMSN, four frequency assignment options are provided to meet different application requirements. A scalable media access is designed with efficient broadcast support. Also, an optimal nonuniform back-off algorithm is derived and its lightweight approximation is implemented in MMSN, which significantly reduces congestion in the time synchronized media access design. Through extensive experiments, MMSN exhibits the prominent ability to utilize parallel transmissions among neighboring nodes. When multiple physical frequencies are available, it also achieves increased energy efficiency, demonstrating the ability to work against radio interference and the tolerance to a wide range of measured time synchronization errors.},

This review summarizes some examples of interventions and their use of media conducted within the old communications landscape of the 1970s and 1980s and the key lessons learned from their design, implementation, and evaluation. We then consider the potential and evidence base for using contemporary technology applications and platforms—within the new communications landscape—to improve the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases in the future. We discuss the implications and adaptation of lessons derived from the ways in which new technologies are being used in commercial and political contexts and their relevance for public health. Finally, we consider some recent examples of applying new technologies to public health issues and consider some of the challenges in this rapidly developing field.},

We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users' needs. Our findings can inform future smart speaker designs; in particular we recommend better integrating privacy controls into smart speaker interaction.},

By serving as a natural interface to services ranging from home automation to media players, conversational assistants help people perform many tasks with ease, such as setting timers, playing music and managing to-do lists. While these systems offer useful capabilities, they are largely passive and unaware of the human behavioral context in which they are used. In this work, we explore how off-the-shelf conversational assistants can be enhanced with acoustic-based human activity recognition by leveraging the short interval after a voice command is given to the device. Since always-on audio recording can pose privacy concerns, our method is unique in that it does not require capturing and analyzing any audio other than the speech-based interactions between people and their conversational assistants. In particular, we leverage background environmental sounds present in these short duration voice-based interactions to recognize activities of daily living. We conducted a study with 14 participants in 3 different locations in their own homes. We showed that our method can recognize 19 different activities of daily living with average precision of 84.85% and average recall of 85.67% in a leave-one-participant-out performance evaluation with 30-second audio clips bound by the voice interactions.},

However, recent studies have revealed that the use of AI speakers decreases over time, which shows that current agents do not fully support smart homes. Because of this problem, the possibility of unobtrusive, invisible intelligence without a physical device has been suggested. To explore CA design direction that enhances the user experience in smart homes, we aimed to understand each feature by comparing an invisible agent with visible ones embedded in stand-alone AI speakers. We conducted a drawing study to examine users' mental models formed through communicating with two different physical entities (i.e., visible and invisible CAs). From the drawings, interviews, and surveys, we identified how users' mental models and interactions differed depending on the presence of a physical entity. We found that a physical entity affected users' perceptions, expectations, and interactions toward the agent.},

JITAIs show great potential because they aim to provide the right type and amount of support, at the right time. Timing the delivery of a JITAI such as the user is receptive and available to engage with the intervention is crucial for a JITAI to succeed. Although previous research has extensively explored the role of context in users' responsiveness towards generic phone notifications, it has not been thoroughly explored for actual mHealth interventions. In this work, we explore the factors affecting users' receptivity towards JITAIs. To this end, we conducted a study with 189 participants, over a period of 6 weeks, where participants received interventions to improve their physical activity levels. The interventions were delivered by a chatbot-based digital coach -Ally - which was available on Android and iOS platforms.We define several metrics to gauge receptivity towards the interventions, and found that (1) several participant-specific characteristics (age, personality, and device type) show significant associations with the overall participant receptivity over the course of the study, and that (2) several contextual factors (day/time, phone battery, phone interaction, physical activity, and location), show significant associations with the participant receptivity, in-the-moment. Further, we explore the relationship between the effectiveness of the intervention and receptivity towards those interventions; based on our analyses, we speculate that being receptive to interventions helped participants achieve physical activity goals, which in turn motivated participants to be more receptive to future interventions. Finally, we build machine-learning models to detect receptivity, with up to a 77% increase in F1 score over a biased random classifier.},

    abstract		= {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a naïve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

Despite extensive prior studies on interruptibility, however, our understanding of the receptivity of mobile JIT health intervention is limited. This work extends prior interruptibility models to capture the JIT intervention process by including multiple stages of conscious and subconscious decisions. We built BeActive, a mobile intervention system for preventing prolonged sedentary behaviors, and we collected users' responses to a given JIT support and relevant contextual factors and cognitive/physical states for three weeks. Using a multi-stage model, we systematically analyzed the responses to deepen our understanding of receptivity using a mixed methodology. Herein, we identify the key factors relevant to each stage outcome and show that the receptivity of JIT intervention is nuanced and context-dependent. We propose several practical design implications for mobile JIT health intervention and context-aware computing.},

Drawing from theories in social psychology and computer science, we explore how device-delivered haptic feedback may have the capability to augment consumer responses to certain consumer-directed communications. Across four studies, we find that haptic alerts accompanying messages can improve consumer performance on related tasks and demonstrate that this effect is driven by an increased sense of social presence in what can otherwise feel like an impersonal technological exchange. These findings provide applied value for mobile marketers and gadget designers, and carry important implications for consumer compliance in health and fitness domains.},

To address the privacy leakage issue during the speech interaction or accommodate some special demands, silent speech interfaces have been proposed to enable people's communication without vocalizing their sound (e.g., lip reading, tongue tracking). However, most existing silent speech mechanisms require either background illuminations or additional wearable devices. In this study, we propose the EchoWhisper as a novel user-friendly, smartphone-based silent speech interface. The proposed technique takes advantage of the micro-Doppler effect of the acoustic wave resulting from mouth and tongue movements and assesses the acoustic features of beamformed reflected echoes captured by the dual microphones in the smartphone. Using human subjects who perform a daily conversation task with over 45 different words, our system can achieve a WER (word error rate) of 8.33%, which shows the effectiveness of inferring silent speech content. Moreover, EchoWhisper has also demonstrated its reliability and robustness to a variety of configuration settings and environmental factors, such as smartphone orientations and distances, ambient noises, body motions, and so on.},

In this study, we examined (1) how the varying demands of proactive voice tasks under diverse driving situations impact driver interruptibility, and (2) how drivers adapt their concurrent multitasking of driving and proactive voice tasks, and how the adaptive behaviors are related to driver interruptibility. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that in addition to the driving-task demand, the voice-task demand and adaptive behaviors are also significantly related to driver interruptibility. Additionally, we discuss how our findings can be used to design and realize three types of flow-control mechanisms for voice interactions that can improve driver interruptibility.},

Currently, these systems react to specific wake-words, such as "Alexa," "Siri," or "Ok Google." However, with advancements in natural language processing, the next generation of voice assistants could instead always listen to the acoustic environment and proactively provide services and recommendations based on conversations without being explicitly invoked. We refer to such devices as "always listening voice assistants" and explore expectations around their potential use. In this paper, we report on a 178-participant survey investigating the potential services people anticipate from such a device and how they feel about sharing their data for these purposes. Our findings reveal that participants can anticipate a wide range of services pertaining to a conversation; however, most of the services are very similar to those that existing voice assistants currently provide with explicit commands. Participants are more likely to consent to share a conversation when they do not find it sensitive, they are comfortable with the service and find it beneficial, and when they already own a stand-alone voice assistant. Based on our findings we discuss the privacy challenges in designing an always-listening voice assistant.},

When initiating conversational interactions proactively, smart speakers need to consider users' contexts to minimize disruption. In this work, we aim to broaden our understanding of opportune moments for proactive conversational interactions in domestic contexts. Toward this goal, we built a voice-based experience sampling device and conducted a one-week field study with 40 participants living in university dormitories. From 3,572 in-situ user experience reports, we proposed 19 activity categories to investigate contextual factors related to interruptibility. Our data analysis results show that the key determinants for opportune moments are closely related to both personal contextual factors such as busyness, mood, and resource conflicts for dual-tasking, and the other contextual factors associated with the everyday routines at home, including user mobility and social presence. Based on these findings, we discuss the need for designing context-aware proactive conversation management features that dynamically control conversational interactions based on users' contexts and routines.},

Background: I describe the discoveries and developments regarding multiple resource theory that have emerged over the past 50 years that contribute to performance and workload prediction. Method: The article presents a history of the multiple resource concept, a computational version of the multiple resource model applied to multitask driving simulation data, and the relation of multiple resources to workload. Results: Research revealed the importance of the four dimensions in accounting for task interference and the association of resources with brain structure. Multiple resource models yielded high correlations between model predictions and data. Lower correlations also identified the existence of additional resources. Conclusion: The model was shown to be partially relevant to the concept of mental workload, with greatest relevance to performance breakdowns related to dual-task overload. Future challenges are identified. Application: The most important application of the multiple resource model is to recommend design changes when conditions of multitask resource overload exist.},

To this end, we conducted interviews with 18 families and collected their Google Home Activity logs to understand the usage patterns of adults and children. Our findings reveal that there are substantial differences in the ways smart speakers are used by adults and children in families over an extended period of time. We report on how parents influence children's use and how different users perceive the devices. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide guidelines for improving the design of future smart speakers and conversational agents.},

    abstract		= {Auditory-verbal interactions with in-vehicle information systems have become increasingly popular for improving driver safety because they obviate the need for distractive visual-manual operations. This opens up new possibilities for enabling proactive auditory-verbal services where intelligent agents proactively provide contextualized recommendations and interactive decision-making. However, prior studies have warned that such interactions may consume considerable attentional resources, thus negatively affecting driving performance. This work aims to develop a machine learning model that can find opportune moments for the driver to engage in proactive auditory-verbal tasks by using the vehicle and environment sensor data. Given that there is a lack of definition about what constitutes interruptibility for auditory-verbal tasks, we first define interruptible moments by considering multiple dimensions and then iteratively develop the experimental framework through an extensive literature review and four pilot studies. We integrate our framework into OsmAnd, an open-source navigation service, and perform a real-road field study with 29 drivers to collect sensor data and user responses. Our machine learning analysis shows that opportune moments for interruption can be conservatively inferred with an accuracy of 0.74. We discuss how our experimental framework and machine learning models can be used to design intelligent auditory-verbal services in practical deployment contexts.},

However, the use of these systems over time in the home has not been studied in depth. We set out to understand exactly what users are doing with these devices over time through analyzing voice history logs of 65,499 interactions with existing Google Home devices from 88 diverse homes over an average of 110 days. We found that specific types of commands were made more often at particular times of day and that commands in some domains increased in length over time as participants tried out new ways to interact with their devices, yet exploration of new topics was low. Four distinct user groups also emerged based on using the device more or less during the day vs. in the evening or using particular categories. We conclude by comparing smart speaker use to a similar study of smartphone use and offer implications for the design of new smart speaker assistants and skills, highlighting specific areas where both manufacturers and skill providers can focus in this domain.},

                    A
                    concurrent object
                    is a data structure shared by concurrent processes. Conventional techniques for implementing concurrent objects typically rely on
                    critical sections
                    ; ensuring that only one process at a time can operate on the object. Nevertheless, critical sections are poorly suited for asynchronous systems: if one process is halted or delayed in a critical section, other, nonfaulty processes will be unable to progress. By contrast, a concurrent object implementation is
                    lock free
                    if it always guarantees that some process will complete an operation in a finite number of steps, and it is
                    wait free
                    if it guarantees that
                    each
                    process will complete an operation in a finite number of steps. This paper  proposes a new methodology for constructing lock-free and  wait-free implementations of concurrent objects. The object's representation and operations are written as stylized sequential programs, with no explicit synchronization. Each sequential operation is atutomatically transformed into a lock-free or wait-free operation using novel synchronization and memory management algorithms. These algorithms are presented for a multiple instruction/multiple data (MIMD) architecture in which
                    n
                    processes communicate by applying atomic
                    read, write, load_linked,
                    and
                    store_conditional
                    operations to a shared memory.
